# Optimizing Hotel Revenue with Power BI

# Executive Summary 
This project utilized data analytics methodologies to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard for Lake Grant Hotels, a fictitious 5-star hotel chain facing 
industry competition. The dashboard empowers the management team with actionable insights to optimize revenue generation strategies.

Project Goals:
Design a user-friendly dashboard to analyze hotel revenue performance across various metrics.
Facilitate data exploration and discovery for informed decision-making.
Collaborate with a domain expert (revenue manager) to refine dashboard functionality.

# Business Problem
1. Profitability: While the revenue figures are high (over 1.6 billion), it is unclear whether this translates to a profit for the company. There may be high costs associated with running the hotels that are eating into the revenue.
2. Revenue by category: There is a category called "Weekend" that has a much higher revenue per room night (RevPAR) than weekdays. This suggests that the company may be able to increase overall profitability by attracting more business travelers during the week.
3. Occupancy rate: The occupancy rate for the hotels is around 58%, which is not terrible, but there may be room for improvement. The company could look at ways to attract more guests, such as by offering discounts or promotions.

# Methodology
This project adopted a data analytics approach to develop a business intelligence dashboard:

Data Acquisition & Cleaning: A hospitality dataset mimicking Lake Grant Hotels was obtained (details omitted due to confidentiality). Data cleaning procedures ensured data accuracy.
Dashboard Development: Power BI was used to create an interactive dashboard visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) like revenue, occupancy rate, and average rating. User-friendly features like city filters, status filters, and platform filters were incorporated.
Stakeholder Engagement: A mock-up dashboard was presented to a domain expert (revenue manager) for feedback. This resulted in the inclusion of crucial metrics like RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) and ADR (Average Daily Rate).
Iterative Refinement: The dashboard was further enhanced based on expert feedback. This included adding a drill-down level for individual property data and planning for two additional visuals (details withheld for future implementation).

# Skills Utilized
Data Analysis: Techniques for data acquisition, cleaning, and manipulation.
Business Intelligence (BI): Proficiency in Power BI for dashboard development.
Data Visualization: Skills to create clear and informative visuals for data exploration.
Communication: Collaboration with stakeholders to understand requirements and translate them into actionable insights.

# Results 
A comprehensive Power BI dashboard providing real-time insights into hotel revenue performance across various metrics.
Improved capability for the management team to identify trends, opportunities, and areas for revenue optimization.
Demonstration of the value of stakeholder engagement in data analytics projects.

# Business Recommendations
1. Investigate ways to improve profitability. This could involve reducing costs or increasing revenue.
2. Look at ways to attract more business travelers during the week. This could involve offering discounts or promotions.
3. Consider strategies to improve occupancy rates.
